The include function in Helm templates is used to call and include the output of another template (often a helper template) within a chart.

{{ include "template-name" . }}

_helpers.tpl

{{- define "mychart.fullname" -}}
{{ .Release.Name }}-{{ .Chart.Name }}
{{- end -}}

Now, in a deployment file (deployment.yaml):

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: {{ include "mychart.fullname" . }}

The with function in Helm templates is used to change the context (.) within a block, making it easier to access nested values without repeatedly specifying the full path.

with replaces . with <value> inside the block.

This is useful for working with deeply nested values.

values.yaml

app:
  name: my-app
  replicaCount: 3

deployment.yaml

metadata:
  name: {{ .Values.app.name }}
spec:
  replicas: {{ .Values.app.replicaCount }}

You can nest with blocks for deeply nested structures.

{{- with .Values.app.database }}
database:
  name: {{ .name }}
  user: {{ .user }}
{{- end }}
